Below is a user query and an instruction which specifies what keywords should or should not be included in the response to the query. Your task is to generate a new instruction based on the original one, but filling in the keyword placeholder(s) with keywords or key phrases that are relevant to the query. Optionally, if present, you should also replace the placeholder {{N}} with a numerical value that fits the context of the instruction.

The input is enclosed in the <query></query> and <instruction></instruction> tags. Your output should be in JSON format, containing three values:
- instruction: this should be the rephrased instruction with the filled in values
- keywords: a keyword or a list of keywords or key phrases that got filled in the instruction
- N: optionally, the numerical value in the instruction, if the instruction contains a placeholder {{N}}

Example input #1:
<query>Can the window size of a Microsoft form be adjusted to fit a mobile screen?</query>
<instruction>The answer must include the keyword {{keyword}} in the {{N}}-th sentence.</instruction>
Example output #1:
```json
{{
    "instruction" = "The answer must include the keyword \"responsive design\" in the second sentence.",
    "keywords" = [
        "responsive design"
    ],
    "N" = "2"
}}
```

Example input #2:
<query>What is choline?</query>
<instruction>Include keywords {{keyword1}}, {{keyword2}} {{N}} times in your response.</instruction>
Example output #2:
```json
{{
    "instruction" = "Include keywords \"nutrient\", \"neurotransmitter\" 3 times in your response.",
    "keywords" = [
        "nutrient",
        "neurotransmitter"
    ],
    "N" = "3"
}}
```

Example input #3:
<query>What are the benefits of meditation?</query>
<instruction>Do not include keywords {{forbidden_words}} in the response.</instruction>
Example output #3:
```json
{{
    "instruction" = "Do not include keywords \"stress\", \"anxiety\", \"depression\" in the response.",
    "keywords" = [
        "stress",
        "anxiety",
        "depression"
    ]
}}
```

Input: 
<query>{query}</query>
<instruction>{instruction}</instruction>

Output: include only the JSON object enclosed in triple backticks and nothing else.
