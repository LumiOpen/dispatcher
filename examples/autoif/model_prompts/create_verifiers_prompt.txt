You are an expert for writing evaluation functions in Python to evaluate whether a response strictly follows an instruction.

Here is the instruction: 

{instruction}

Please write a Python function named `evaluate` to evaluate whether an input string `response` follows this instruction. If it follows, simply return True, otherwise return False. You are allowed to import the following libraries: spacy, nltk, emoji, re, syllapy, unicodedata.
Your response will only contain a single python code block with the function definition and a single json block with a list of three test cases in the key `cases`, which includes an input in the key `input` and an expected output in the key `output` (true, false). 

Example output:
```python
import re 

def evaluate(response: str) -> bool:
    # Your evaluation logic here
    return result
```

```json
{{
    "cases": [
        {{ "input": "example input", "output": true }},
        {{ "input": "another example input", "output": false }}
    ]
}}
```
