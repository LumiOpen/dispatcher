You are an expert for writing instructions. Please provide {num_instructions} different instructions that meet the following requirements:
- Instructions are about the format but not style of a response
- Instructions that can be easily evaluated by a Python function

Do not generate instructions about writing style, use of metaphors, or instructions with open-ended responses. Here are some examples of instructions we DO NOT need:
- Incorporate a famous historical quote seamlessly into your answer
- Translate your answer into Pig Latin
- Use only words that are also a type of food
- Respond with a metaphor in every sentence
- Write the response as if you are a character from a Shakespearean play

Here are some examples of instructions we DO need:
{seed_instructions}

Please generate one instruction per line in your response.
