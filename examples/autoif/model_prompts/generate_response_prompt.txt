You are given a query, which asks for specific information, and a list of constraints, which specifies how your response should be formatted or constrained.
Your task is to generate a response that correctly answers the query while strictly adhering to the constraints.

Note that there might be 1 or more constraints to follow. You should follow all of them simultaneously!

- The query defines what to answer.
- The constraints define how to answer: e.g., by including certain keywords, structuring the response in a certain way, or restricting the type of content.

Respond in a way that both:

1. Accurately addresses the query, and
2. Fully adheres to the constraints.

Query: {query}
Constraints: {instructions}
