Your task is to augment the given list of seed instructions by generating new, distinct instructions in {language} language. You should generate {num_instructions} instructions, with each new instruction being unique and creative.

# Parameters
- Category: {category}
- Description: {description}
- Subcategories: {subcategories}

# Constraints and Criteria
1.  **Verifiability:** Every generated instruction must be verifiable by a Python function. This means the instruction should describe a specific requirement for the text output, not a subjective style. 

- Bad examples to avoid:
  - "Write a beautiful poem about time." (subjective, unverifiable)
  - "Summarize a Wikipedia article about physics." (requires external knowledge)
  - "Include a clever pun in your answer." (subjective)

2.  **Specificity**: Instructions must be specific enough for a Python function to verify the output without ambiguity. If an instruction mentions structures (paragraphs, sections, lists), you must define their boundaries explicitly.

- Bad examples to avoid:
  - "Write 3 paragraphs." (ambiguous paragraph definition)
  - "Provide a structured list." (structure not defined)
  - "Include several sections." (unclear what counts as a ‘section’)

- Good examples:
  - "Write exactly 3 paragraphs, where each paragraph is separated by a double newline (\n\n)." (clear paragraph definition)
  - "Provide a numbered list with at least 5 items." (clear structure)
  - "Include exactly 2 sections, each starting with a heading in uppercase letters." (clear section definition)

3.  **No Open-ended Knowledge Questions:** Avoid instructions that require external or factual knowledge, depend on world understanding or .

- Bad examples to avoid:
  - "Use only words that are also a type of food." (requires knowledge)
  - "Incorporate a famous historical quote into your answer." (requires knowledge)
  - "List the capital cities of 5 European countries." (requires knowledge)
  - "Name 3 books by famous authors." (knowledge-based)
  - "Mention one historical event per century." (requires external context)

4.  **No Subjective Style:** Do not request stylistic, tonal, or emotional instructions. Focus on verifiable structure, not style or tone.
  - "Write the response in the style of a Shakespearean play." (Style)
  - "Respond with a metaphor in every sentence" (Style)
  - "Write the response in a humorous tone." (Tone)
  - "Respond as if you were a pirate." (Tone)
  - "Create an inspiring speech." (Tone)

5.  **No Translation:** Do not generate instructions that require translating the input into another language.

6.  **Creativity and Uniqueness:** The goal is to maximize creativity and minimize repetition. Each instruction should introduce a new kind of verifiable rule, not minor variations (like changing a number or word). Explore different structural, lexical, and positional constraints.

7. **Atomicity:** Each instruction should focus on a single, clear requirement. Avoid combining multiple requirements into one instruction.
- Bad examples to avoid:
  - "Write a paragraph of 3 sentences, and each sentence must rhyme." (multiple checks)
  - "Produce 2 paragraphs, each with 3 bullet points." (two levels of constraints)
  - "Create a poem with 4 lines and make the last word ‘sunrise’." (structure + content)

# Output Format
Generate each instruction on a new line. Note that seed instructions can contain placeholders such as {{N}}, {{end phrase}}, etc. In your response, replace these placeholders with actual appropriate values. Do not ask for unreasonable values that would make the response overly long, such as "20+ paragraphs"; use common-sense.
