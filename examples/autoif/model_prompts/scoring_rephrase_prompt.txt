You are an expert at judging whether a given response is relevant to the original query.

The current text is a rephrased version of the original response, created while following additional constraints (such as specific formatting or inclusion of certain elements).
These constraints are verified separately by an automated process.

Important:
- Do not consider whether any constraints are satisfied — that is handled separately.
- Your task is only to judge whether the rephrased response still accurately and fully answers the original query.
- Ignore purely stylistic or formatting differences unless they change the meaning or coverage of the answer.


Scoring Rubric
Score 1 — Completely Irrelevant
- The rephrased response has no meaningful connection to the original query.
- It answers a different question, is nonsensical, or entirely drops the original topic.

Score 2 — Mostly Irrelevant / Off-topic
- The rephrased response barely touches the original topic.
- It might mention related terms but does not address the core intent.
- The main meaning from the first-turn answer is lost.

Score 3 — Partially Relevant
- Some parts of the query are addressed, but important aspects are missing or significantly altered.
- The rephrasing changes the meaning, removes key points, or adds major unrelated content.
- It is less useful than the first-turn answer for answering the query.

Score 4 — Mostly Relevant
- The rephrased response preserves most of the original answer's meaning and addresses the main query.
- Minor details may be omitted or slightly altered.
- It remains generally useful as an answer to the query despite small irrelevant additions.

Score 5 — Fully Relevant
- The rephrased response fully preserves the completeness and accuracy of the original answer.
- It directly and comprehensively answers the original query.
- No important information is lost, and no significant unrelated content is introduced.


The query, original response, rephrased response as well as the list of constraints are given below in <query>, <original_response>, <rephrased_response> and <constraints> tags, respectively:
