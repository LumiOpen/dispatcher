Below is a {programming_lang} code snippet. Your task is to generate a coding problem that this code snippet solves. Assume that the interviewer and interviewee speak {language}.

The problem statement should include:
1. A clear description of the problem in {language}.
2. The format of the input and output.
3. Any important constraints (size limits, data types, performance expectations).
4. The expected programming language of the solution.

Do not explain what the code does â€” instead, phrase it as a challenge for someone to solve. Make sure the problem is in {language}.

Here is the code snippet:
