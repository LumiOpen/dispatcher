## Definition of an \"Instruction\":
In the context of training a large language model (LLM) for an AI assistant, an \"instruction\" can be characterized as a specific directive or command given to the model to perform a particular task or behave in a certain way. An instruction for training an AI assistant is a clear, concise statement or question that:

1. Directs the model to perform a specific action or task 
2. Provides context for the desired behavior or output 
3. Include constraints or specific requirements as to the format of the output
4. Is typically phrased in natural language
5. Can be general or domain-specific

Instructions are used to fine-tune the model’s behavior, helping it understand and respond appropriately to various user inputs and scenarios. They are crucial in shaping the AI assistant’s capabilities and ensuring it aligns with the intended use case. Instructions typically fall into one of the categories below:

1. Problem Solving: Coding, Mathematical reasoning, Knowledge and reasoning, Logic puzzles
2. Creative Tasks: Creative writing, Brainstorming, Planning
3. Information Processing: Summarization, Extraction, Classification, Translation 
4. Text Transformation: Rewriting, rephrasing, text simplification
5. Roleplay and Simulation: Inhabiting a character/persona
6. Advisory: Life coaching, productivity guidance
7. Domain-Specific Knowledge: STEM, humanities, history, social studies
8. Adversarial: ambiguous or underspecified requests, attempts at misdirection, unsafe or inappropriate requests, noisy or ungrammatical prompts

## Definition of a \"Conversation\":
In the context of an LLM, a conversation is composed of one or more turns where each turn is composed of an instruction from the user and an answer from the assisant. A turn always starts with the user's instruction.

## Task Description:
Considering the definition of an Instruction and Conversation, analyze the following {language} document and a conversation based on the document. Then perform a three-step analysis:
<document>
{document}
</document>

<conversation>
{conversation}
</conversation>

Firstly, try to give a short summary in {language} of the document. This should help you better understand the document.

Secondly, using knowledge gained from the conversation and the document, start the next turn of the conversation by creating a new instruction based on the previous turn. Prioritize complex instructions that require domain knowledge and reasoning to solve. Complex instructions typically require domain expertise and synthesis of multiple concepts to solve. Aim to create a new instruction that falls into the {category} category. Aim to create a new instruction that is significantly different from the previous instruction. Note that the instruction should be understandable **without requiring access to the document**. The instruction can refer to information in the conversation. The instruction should be clear and detailed enough for the model to comprehend the task without seeing the document.

Finally, categorize the instruction into one of the categories defined above. 

Provide your final response in the following format:

SUMMARY: <summary of the document in {language}>
INSTRUCTION: <{language} instruction for which the answer is in the conversation or the document above> 
CATEGORY: <one of the categories above>

NOTE: \"SUMMARY\", \"INSTRUCTION\" and \"CATEGORY\" keywords must be kept in English without any change while the generated summary and instruction should be in {language}.

DO NOT provide the actual response to the instruction and make sure the instruction is in {language}!
